    <h1>Vehicle</h1>

<p class="biggerText">A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup>[1]</sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles,
   motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), 
   amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup>[2]</sup>
</p>

<p class="biggerText">Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
   wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation,
   for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup>[3]</sup>
